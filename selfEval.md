1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    I feel confident. They're pretty straightforward. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    One of the stumped challenges I tried involved an if statement and ||. I will have to look this over again, and do some more research. Intellectually I understand but translating that into syntax is still difficult for me. Not confident. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    If/else statements take me back to preparing for turing with the logic games, so it feels like stretching a muscle I haven't used in awhile. Though I did learn that it gets easier over time, thinking is this very linear way. The cognition side of things is my biggest hold up right now. I'm slowly reasoning through problems, breaking them down, reading them over and over, sometimes outloud, and it is getting better. 

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

    I was feeling very confident with the provided material, but when it came time to do some googling I felt like I was in much deeper water. Goolging however does expose me to the wider langauge of programming, tons of vocab and such that I'm not familiar with yet. I did attempt the harder challenges but couldn't complete, so I have some errors to look into tonight. Overall I feel moderately confident, which is to say at this level, I understand what they're trying to do even when I can't get the syntax right. 

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

    I still need to get better about time management. Not only calendar upkeep but also predicting how long assignments will take. I'm finding that I need to look over each assignment to get a feel for the material before commiting to a timeline. That's been a helpful adjustment as I've been able to update my predictions and block out more reasonably as the weeks have progressed. Spoiler: It's taken me about x2 as long as I expected.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    I have questions about formatting boolean arrays. I will submit a detailed question tonight after some youtube and stack overflow.
